/**
 * A deliberately empty receiver whose only job is to exist.
 *
 * LightOS decides what counts as a "tool" by querying broadcast receivers for
 * com.thelightphone.sdk.ACTION_SDK_MARKER and reading their SDK_VERSION
 * metadata. Apps carrying that marker stay in the toolbox even when external
 * tools are switched off; plain apps are filtered out.
 *
 * Declaring the marker lets Routine be listed as a tool while remaining an
 * ordinary Android app — which it must be, because a real light-sdk tool has
 * no way to vibrate or wake with the screen off.
 *
 * This is an undocumented mechanism inferred from the device. It may break on
 * any LightOS update.
