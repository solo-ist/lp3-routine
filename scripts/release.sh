# Build, verify and install as one fail-fast operation.
#
# The point: nothing reaches the phone unless verification passed, and what
# gets installed is exactly the artifact that was verified. Running build,
# verify and install as three separate shell commands — as the README used to
# suggest — lets an install proceed after a failed verify, because a script's
# exit status cannot stop its caller's next command.
#
# "Exactly" is enforced, not assumed (security audit 2026-09-27):
#   - the build runs on a `git archive` export of HEAD in a private temp
#     directory, so edits made to the working tree mid-build can't reach it
#   - the APK is copied read-only into that directory before verification,
#     and the verified copy is the one installed — not a path in the build
#     tree that something could replace in between
