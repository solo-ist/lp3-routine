# Release gate for Routine.
#
# Routine holds a private run history and wakes the phone on exact alarms. An
# APK signed by the wrong key could replace it and inherit that data; a
# debuggable one could have it read over adb. Five checks, all fatal:
#   1. a pin already exists (enrolment is a separate, explicit act)
#   2. the signer matches it
#   3. the build is not debuggable
#   4. backups are off
#   5. device transfer excludes every data domain
#
# Parsing rules, learned from a security review that broke the previous
# version of this script:
#   - never use `cmd | grep -q` for a security decision. grep exits early,
#     the producer takes SIGPIPE, and under `pipefail` the pipeline reports
#     failure — so `a && fail || ok` reports OK for a *failing* check.
#   - never regex across a whole dump. Match the exact attribute, or an
#     unrelated string elsewhere can satisfy the test.
#   - not even line by line: a label can contain the attribute's text.
#     Parse the tree and read the attribute itself (manifest_gate.py).
